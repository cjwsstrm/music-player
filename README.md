# Music-Player
A winamp inspired web app ~~that will let users connect to their spotify account~~.

## Why? 
I listen to a lot of music and winamp was the go-to player in the past. I thouroughly enjoy the interplay between sound and 
visuals so I want to try and recreate the visualisation feature that seemed much more promininent in music players (or 
maybe just in winamp) a decade or two ago.

## Intended Features
- ~~User music through Spotify~~ -> March 5th 2018, After re-reading the Terms of Use, [[Spotify web API]](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/terms/#iv) does not allow for any synchronization with visual media, nor altering the playback of any audio. Project will instead let users play local sound files.
- Visualisations
- Equalizer
- Audio playback speed control

### Project goals
- Practice responsive design through heavy use of CSS-grid
- Explore the web-audio API
- Explore HTML Canvas through creating audio visualisations
- Explore spotify web API
- Basic data tracking (such as total songs / time played across users)

#### Stretch goals
- Use GraphQL (strictly for learning purposes) 
- Make more advanced visualisations
- Improve UI
- Allow alternate media sources (mp3 files, soundcloud etc)
